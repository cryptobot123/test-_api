It analyzes your workspace and figures out what can be affected by every code change.\nThat's why Nx doesn't rebuild and retest everything on every commit--<strong>it only rebuilds what is necessary</strong>\n.\n\n<strong>Nx</strong> partitions commands into a graph of smaller tasks. Nx then runs those tasks in parallel,\nand <strong>it can even distribute them across multiple machines without any configuration</strong>.\n\n<strong>Nx also uses a distributed computation cache.</strong> If someone has already built or tested similar code, Nx\nwill use their results to speed up the command for everyone else.\n\n### Holistic Dev Experience Powered by an Advanced CLI and Editor Plugins\n\n<strong>Nx</strong> helps scale your development from one team building one application to many teams building multiple\nfrontend and backend applications all in the same workspace. <strong >When using Nx, developers have a holistic dev\nexperience powered by an advanced CLI</strong > (with editor plugins), capabilities for controlled code sharing and\nconsistent code generation.\n\n### Rich Plugin Ecosystem\n\n<strong>Nx</strong> is an open platform with plugins for many modern tools and frameworks. It has support for\nTypeScript, React, Angular, Cypress, Jest, Prettier, Nest.js, Next.js, Storybook, Ionic among others. With Nx, you get a\nconsistent dev experience regardless of the tools used.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Creating an Nx Workspace\n\n**Using `npx`**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-nx-workspace\n```\n\n**Using `npm init`**\n\n```bash\nnpm init nx-workspace\n```\n\n**Using `yarn create`**\n\n```bash\nyarn create nx-workspace\n```\n\nThe `create-nx-workspace` command will ask you to select a preset, which will configure some plugins and create your applications to help you get started.\n\n```\n? What to create in the new workspace (Use arrow keys)\n‚ùØ empty             [an empty workspace with a layout that works best for building apps]\n  oss               [an empty workspace with a layout that works best for open-source projects]\n  web components    [a workspace with a single app built using web components]\n  angular           [a workspace with a single Angular application]\n  angular-nest      [a workspace with a full stack application (Angular + Nest)]\n  react             [a workspace with a single React application]\n  react-express     [a workspace with a full stack application (React + Express)]\n  next.js           [a workspace with a single Next.js application]\n```\n\nSelect the preset that works best for you.\n\n\n## Documentation & Resources\n\nEven though Nx isn't technology specific, we provide 3 separate flavours of the documentation site to it make it easier for you to get up and running.
